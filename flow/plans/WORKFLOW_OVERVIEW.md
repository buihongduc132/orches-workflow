# Orches Workflow Overview

## Project Mission
Create a comprehensive, AI-first GitHub workflow system that enables seamless collaboration between AI agents and human developers while maintaining code quality, proper documentation, and organizational standards.

## Core Components

### 1. Safeguard Policies (`templates/rules/`)
**Purpose**: Enforce workflow standards and prevent common issues

- **validate-pr-scope.yml**: Prevents mixing super/submodule changes in single PRs
- **enforce-pr-links.yml**: Requires proper documentation links in all PRs
- **branch-protection.yml**: Enforces PR-only workflow and approval requirements

**Key Features**:
- File path restrictions for different repository types
- Mandatory linked PR requirements for submodule bumps
- Documentation link validation (wiki, docs, issues)
- AI agent information tracking
- Breaking change documentation requirements

### 2. CLI Extensions (`extensions/`)
**Purpose**: Provide command-line tools for daily workflow operations

#### gh-dy (Day-to-Day Operations)
- **Task Management**: Create, claim, progress, review, close tasks
- **Dashboard Views**: Agent status, review queue, blocked items, cross-component issues
- **Triage Operations**: Auto-assignment, stale issue handling
- **PR Operations**: Status checking, merge automation, draft management
- **Discussion Management**: Feature discussions, comment threading

#### gh-dy-admin (Administrative Setup)
- **Project Setup**: Repository configuration, label management
- **Template Management**: Issue and PR templates
- **Field Configuration**: Project board field setup
- **Bulk Operations**: Organization-wide setup and maintenance

### 3. Bootstrap Scripts (`scripts/`)
**Purpose**: Automated setup and configuration

- **labels-ensure.sh**: Creates standardized AI workflow labels
- **project-ensure-fields.sh**: Sets up project tracking fields

**Standard Labels**:
- `ai-task`: Task for AI agents
- `human-review-needed`: Requires human attention
- `cross-component`: Spans multiple components
- `status:ai-review`: AI review stage
- `status:ai-test`: AI testing stage
- `status:ai-approved`: AI approved stage

### 4. Ansible Automation (`ansible/`)
**Purpose**: Enable easy replication across organizations

- **replicate-workflow.yml**: Main playbook for complete setup
- **setup_repository.yml**: Individual repository configuration
- **Inventory and variables**: Customizable organization settings

## Workflow Principles

### 1. AI-First Design
- Built for AI agent collaboration
- Human oversight at key decision points
- Automated triage and assignment
- AI agent tracking and attribution

### 2. PR-Only Development
- **No direct commits to main/master/develop**
- All changes must go through pull requests
- Mandatory approvals for non-draft PRs
- Automated merge conflict detection

### 3. Documentation-Driven
- **Every PR must link to relevant documentation**
- Issues, wiki pages, or markdown files required
- Breaking changes need migration guides
- Feature PRs require comprehensive documentation

### 4. Scope Separation
- Clear boundaries between super and sub repositories
- Prevents mixing different types of changes
- Enforces linked PR requirements for submodule updates
- Component-based organization

### 5. Quality Gates
- Required status checks before merge
- Automated validation of PR scope and links
- Branch protection with approval requirements
- Breaking change documentation validation

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
1. **Repository Initialization**
   - GitHub CLI setup and authentication
   - Basic repository structure
   - Initial documentation

2. **Core Safeguards**
   - Install GitHub Actions workflows
   - Configure branch protection
   - Set up PR and issue templates

3. **CLI Extensions**
   - Install gh-dy and gh-dy-admin extensions
   - Test basic functionality
   - Create initial labels and project fields

### Phase 2: Organization Rollout
1. **Pilot Repositories**
   - Select 2-3 repositories for initial testing
   - Train core team members
   - Gather feedback and iterate

2. **Gradual Expansion**
   - Use Ansible playbook for bulk setup
   - Repository-by-repository rollout
   - Team training and documentation

3. **Full Adoption**
   - Organization-wide enforcement
   - Monitoring and metrics
   - Continuous improvement

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. **AI Integration**
   - Enhanced AI agent tracking
   - Automated code review assistance
   - Intelligent task assignment

2. **Analytics and Reporting**
   - Workflow metrics dashboard
   - AI vs human contribution tracking
   - Process optimization insights

3. **Cross-Organization Sharing**
   - Public templates and best practices
   - Community contributions
   - Industry standardization

## Success Metrics
